# **Predictive Analysis and Enhanced Prediction for AQI**

This repository presents an **advanced air quality prediction system** that utilizes **deep learning techniques** to analyze and forecast **PM2.5 concentrations**. The project is structured around **two key aspects**:

## **üìà Prediction**
The **LSTM-FCNN hybrid model** is an advanced deep learning architecture designed for **air quality prediction**. This model combines two powerful neural network components:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** ‚Äì Captures **temporal dependencies** in pollution data.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)** ‚Äì Models **feature interactions** and refines predictions.  

This combination allows for **accurate forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations** by leveraging both **time-series patterns** and **environmental influences**.

# **Why LSTM-FCNN Instead of a Normal Regression Model?**
Air quality prediction is **not a simple regression problem** because pollution levels depend on **both past trends (temporal dependencies) and environmental interactions (non-linear dependencies).** The **LSTM-FCNN hybrid model** is specifically designed to handle these complexities, making it superior to traditional regression models.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Dependency (Temporal Aspect)**
- **Air pollution fluctuates over time** due to meteorological conditions (temperature, wind, humidity) and external factors (seasonal changes, industrial activity).
- Traditional regression assumes **each data point is independent**, ignoring past trends that influence future pollution levels.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks excel at capturing **sequential patterns** and **long-term dependencies** in time-series data.

**Example:**  
If PM2.5 is high today, it‚Äôs likely to remain high tomorrow unless significant meteorological changes occur. **LSTM remembers past trends and uses them for forecasting.**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Complex Interactions (Non-Linear Dependencies)**
- PM2.5 concentration is influenced by **multiple factors** (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.).
- Linear regression assumes a **fixed relationship** (e.g., PM2.5 increases by X when temperature drops by Y), which is too simplistic.
- **FCNN (Fully Connected Neural Network)** learns **non-linear interactions** between meteorological features and pollutant concentrations.

**Example:**  
- **Low wind speed & high humidity** ‚Üí PM2.5 increases (pollutants stay in the air longer).  
- **High wind speed & low humidity** ‚Üí PM2.5 decreases (pollutants disperse quickly).  
These **interactions are not linear** and require FCNN to model the relationships effectively.

## **üìå Why LSTM + FCNN Instead of Just LSTM?**
While **LSTM captures temporal patterns**, it **doesn‚Äôt model complex feature interactions** effectively. That‚Äôs where **FCNN enhances the prediction process**.

### **How the LSTM-FCNN Hybrid Works:**
1. **LSTM processes the time-series sequence** and learns how pollution levels change over time.  
2. **FCNN refines the LSTM outputs** by considering **feature interactions** (e.g., how temperature & humidity together impact PM2.5).  
3. **The combined model generates highly accurate predictions**, capturing both **past pollution trends (LSTM)** and **current environmental influences (FCNN).**  

**Example:**  
- LSTM predicts that **PM2.5 will be high tomorrow** based on past pollution levels.  
- FCNN adjusts the prediction by considering **weather conditions**‚Äîif strong winds are forecasted, it lowers the PM2.5 estimate because **pollutants will disperse faster.**  

## **üìå LSTM-FCNN Model Architecture**
The **LSTM-FCNN model** consists of several layers:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **LSTM Network**  
   - **Input:** Sequence of past PM2.5 values.  
   - **Hidden state:** Stores learned pollution trends.  
   - **Output:** Time-dependent pollution forecast.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **FCNN Layers**  
   - **Input:** LSTM output + meteorological features.  
   - **Hidden Layers:** Fully connected layers with **ReLU activation** for feature learning.  
   - **Output Layer:** Final PM2.5 prediction.  

## **‚ö° Optimizer Performance Analysis**
### **Why Optimizer Selection is Crucial**
The choice of **optimizer** significantly impacts **convergence speed and accuracy**. Multiple optimizers were tested:

| **RMSprop**   | Scales gradient updates     | Works well for time-series |
| **SGD**       | Fixed learning rate         | Good for simple models |
| **Adadelta**  | No manual tuning required  | Works well with noisy data |
| **Adagrad**   | Adapts learning per feature | Best for sparse data |
| **Adamax**    | Generalization-focused     | Stable training |
