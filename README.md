# AirQualityPredictions
Predictive Analysis and Enhanced Prediction for AQI
Why LSTM-FCNN Instead of a Normal Regression Model?
Air quality prediction is not a simple regression problem because pollution levels depend on both past trends (temporal dependencies) and environmental interactions (non-linear dependencies). The LSTM-FCNN hybrid model is specifically designed to handle these complexities, making it superior to traditional regression models.

üìå Why is Air Quality Prediction Different from a Normal Regression Problem?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Time-Dependency (Temporal Aspect)
Air pollution fluctuates over time due to meteorological conditions (temperature, wind, humidity) and external factors (seasonal changes, industrial activity).
Traditional regression assumes each data point is independent, ignoring past trends that influence future pollution levels.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks excel at capturing sequential patterns and long-term dependencies in time-series data.
Example:
If PM2.5 is high today, it‚Äôs likely to remain high tomorrow unless significant meteorological changes occur. LSTM remembers past trends and uses them for forecasting.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Complex Interactions (Non-Linear Dependencies)
PM2.5 concentration is influenced by multiple factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.).
Linear regression assumes a fixed relationship (e.g., PM2.5 increases by X when temperature drops by Y), which is too simplistic.
FCNN (Fully Connected Neural Network) learns non-linear interactions between meteorological features and pollutant concentrations.
Example:

Low wind speed & high humidity ‚Üí PM2.5 increases (pollutants stay in the air longer).
High wind speed & low humidity ‚Üí PM2.5 decreases (pollutants disperse quickly).
These interactions are not linear and require FCNN to model the relationships effectively.
üìå Why LSTM + FCNN Instead of Just LSTM?
While LSTM captures temporal patterns, it doesn‚Äôt model complex feature interactions effectively. That‚Äôs where FCNN enhances the prediction process.

How the LSTM-FCNN Hybrid Works:
LSTM processes the time-series sequence and learns how pollution levels change over time.
FCNN refines the LSTM outputs by considering feature interactions (e.g., how temperature & humidity together impact PM2.5).
The combined model generates highly accurate predictions, capturing both past pollution trends (LSTM) and current environmental influences (FCNN).
Example:

LSTM predicts that PM2.5 will be high tomorrow based on past pollution levels.
FCNN adjusts the prediction by considering weather conditions‚Äîif strong winds are forecasted, it lowers the PM2.5 estimate because pollutants will disperse faster.
üìà Comparison: LSTM-FCNN vs. Normal Regression
Aspect	Traditional Regression	LSTM-FCNN
Captures time-series trends	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes (LSTM remembers past values)
Handles non-linear interactions	‚ùå No (Assumes fixed relationships)	‚úÖ Yes (FCNN learns complex patterns)
Considers external meteorological factors	‚úÖ Limited	‚úÖ Yes (FCNN models impact of weather)
Adapts to seasonal variations	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes (LSTM captures seasonal changes)

üìå Final Justification: Why LSTM-FCNN is the Best Choice
Captures both time-series trends (LSTM) and complex feature interactions (FCNN).
Adapts to real-world pollution dynamics, unlike traditional regression models.
Achieves lower RMSE and higher prediction accuracy compared to standalone LSTM or regression models.
üöÄ LSTM-FCNN is designed to model real-world air quality variations, making it the optimal choice over traditional regression techniques!
